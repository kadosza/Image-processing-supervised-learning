## 1. Project description:
The MNIST is a dataset of 70,000  28Ã—28 pixel images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9. The aim of this report was to use Random Forest Classifier to create a classification model to correctly identify digits and check model performance using confusion matrix and accuracy score.

## 2. The project contains the following analyses: 
* **Data pre-processing and splitting into train-test-dev sets** 
* **Optimising model max_depth**
* **Optimising model n_estimators**
* **Prediction modelling based on the most optimal parameters**
* **Running confusion matrix to assess separation**
* **Calculating accuracy scores**
